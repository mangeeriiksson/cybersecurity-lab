This directory contains Bash and Python scripts created to automate and support tasks in my cybersecurity lab environment.

---

## * Purpose

The main goals of these scripts are to:

- Automate repetitive tasks (backups, updates, monitoring)
- Streamline log collection and analysis
- Assist in vulnerability scanning and enumeration
- Provide tooling to speed up lab setup and resets

---

## * Examples of Included Scripts

- **Backup Automation:**
  - Scheduled backups of pfSense configurations
  - VM snapshot creation in Proxmox

- **Log Management:**
  - Log parsing and enrichment scripts for Suricata and pfSense logs
  - Custom filters for extracting high-severity events

- **Monitoring Helpers:**
  - Simple Bash scripts to check service status across VMs
  - Notifications for disk space and resource usage

- **Vulnerability Scanning:**
  - Wrapper scripts for Nmap and Nikto with predefined parameters
  - Output formatting for easy SIEM ingestion

---

## * Usage

Each script includes:

- Inline comments describing purpose and usage
- Requirements or dependencies (e.g., Python modules)
- Example commands for running

---

## * Lessons Learned

- Automating routine tasks saves significant time during lab resets
- Consistent script logging simplifies troubleshooting
- Bash is often sufficient, but Python offers more flexibility for complex parsing

---

## * Screenshots

*(Add screenshots here, e.g., example script output, cron job configurations.)*
